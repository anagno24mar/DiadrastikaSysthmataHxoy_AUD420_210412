## Œùecessary advices to seafarers.
- Sound Control.

Regardless of experience, every professional or beginner user of the Super Collider must do an audio check before starting to create his/her own audio track. So, there are 3 different but equaly easy ways to apply the sound check.

       1. ().play; // Plays default sound (Stereo) for 1 second.
       2. { PinkNoise.ar(0.1) }.play; // Continuous Pink noise, Mono. Press command + . to stop sound.
       3. Synth(\default); // Continuous default sound, stereo. Press command + . to stop sound.
