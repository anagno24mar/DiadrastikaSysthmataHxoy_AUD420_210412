## Œùecessary advices to seafarers.
- Sound Control.

Regardless of experience, every professional or beginner user of the Super Collider must do an audio check before starting to create his/her own audio track. So, there are 3 different but equaly easy ways to apply the sound check.

       1. ().play; // Plays default sound (Stereo) for 1 second.
       2. { PinkNoise.ar(0.1) }.play; // Continuous Pink noise, Mono. Press command + . to stop sound.
       3. Synth(\default); // Continuous default sound, stereo. Press command + . to stop sound.

## Pay Attention below!!!

On the occasion of today's university course(AUD420), at the School of Sound and Visual Arts, which took place online, using the Zoom platform, I would like to share with you a problem that we were called to face. For the needs of the lesson, at some point I had to share screen and audio, in order to experiment by changing the codes in the Super Collider. So while I had shared my screen and sound normally, I was inside the Super Collider application and when I booted the server suddenly the sound was lost, so I could not hear any of the participants in the lesson. They could not hera me too. That's why, we tried different ways to restore audio communication during screen and audio sharing. Probably, this problem can plague you quite often, especially nowadays, where the conditions of education, in the midst of COVID-19, are terminated exclusively through the internet. 

## Possible Solutions

- At first, start to share your screen and sound and then go to Super Collider's server and click : Boot Server
- Another solution is to share firstly your screen only. Then you can Boot your Server at Super Collider and after all you can also share your computer sound.

       If none of the 2 previous actions work, you can follow these final steps!!
       
- Open Super Collider to your computer first! Boot the server and then you can saftly share your computer's screen and sound, without problems.
