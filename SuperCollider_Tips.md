## Œùecessary advices to seafarers.
- Sound Control.

Regardless of experience, every professional or beginner user of the Super Collider must do an audio check before starting to create his/her own audio track. So, there are 3 different but equaly easy ways to apply the sound check.

       1. ().play; // Plays default sound (Stereo) for 1 second.
       2. { PinkNoise.ar(0.1) }.play; // Continuous Pink noise, Mono. Press command + . to stop sound.
       3. Synth(\default); // Continuous default sound, stereo. Press command + . to stop sound.

## Pay Attention below!!!

On the occasion of today's university course(AUD420), at the School of Sound and Visual Arts, which took place online, using the Zoom platform, I would like to share with you a problem that we were called to face. For the needs of the lesson, at some point I had to share screen and audio, in order to experiment by changing the codes in the Super Collider. So while I had shared my screen and sound normally, I was inside the Super Collider application and when I booted the server suddenly the sound was lost, so I could not hear any of the participants in the lesson. They were at the same situation.
